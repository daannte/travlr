## About The Website

I decided to make a travel itinerary website because I am going on a 2 week
northern Europe trip in August 2023. The purpose of this website was to provide
a way for me to easily manage all my itineraries. I made a login feature so multiple
people can use the website at the same time without changing each others itineraries.

## Roadmap

- [x] Add a drag feature to move the activities around.
- [x] Make a feature to download the itinerary as a PDF.
- [x] Use the Places API to have a autocomplete for destinations. (I used the FOURSQUARE API instead.)
- [x] Get better at UI/UX design so I can make the app look better.
